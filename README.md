# Cloney

### Info
Cloney is an all-around Discord bot with commands ranging from the `Help` Command to cool and fun `slap` commands. This bot is for everyone you can modify it like, adding a background image to the welcome message and all sorts of things!

### Goal
The goal of the Cloney Bot developers is to get this bot into 100 different servers, by doing so it will get verified by Discord and get the developer badge. Then after all of that is done we will continue to add more commands and soon get a *Premium Subscription* available to players with Cloney in one of their servers, the *Premium Subscription* will add a wide-ranging variety of commands which will be available to the player that donated or has a *Premium Subscription*


### Past
Cloney began as a tiny collaboration between friends in 2020.
